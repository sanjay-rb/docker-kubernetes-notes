# 🐳 Docker & Kubernetes Notes

This repository contains notes and commands related to Docker and Kubernetes.

> **💡 Note:** This repository includes references to various Dockerfiles with names formatted like `Dockerfile [notes]`. When running these on your machine, be sure to remove the square brackets (`[]`) from the filename. Docker requires the file to be named exactly `Dockerfile`, without any extensions or additional characters.

## 🛠️ Manipulating Containers with Docker CLI

Runs BusyBox and echoes a message.

```
Hello World!
```

### 📦 `docker create hello-world`

Creates a container without starting it.

### 📄 Introduction to Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions to build a Docker image. It automates the process of creating containerized environments, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

### 🧩 Basic Dockerfile Blocks:

1. 🏷️ Specify the base image.
2. ⚡ Run necessary boot scripts to the image.
3. 🏁 Define the commands to run during the container's startup.

```
# 1. Specify the base image.
FROM alpine

# 2. Run necessary boot scripts to the image.
RUN apk add --update redis

# 3. Define the commands to run during the container's startup.
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

### 🖼️ What? An Image Can Be Created from a Container!?

Yes, that's correct! You can create a new Docker image from any running container by specifying a start command (CMD).

To do this manually, use the following Docker CLI command:

```sh
docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"]' <CONTAINER_ID>
```

### 🏷️ Can We Name (or Tag) Docker Images?

Absolutely! You can assign a name (or tag) to your Docker images using the following methods:

1. **🏷️ Tagging during build:**

   ```sh
   docker build -t sanjoke/redis:latest .
   ```

   - This command tags the image as you build it.
   - Here, `sanjoke` is your Docker Hub username, `redis` is the custom image name, and `latest` is the tag.

2. **🏷️ Tagging an existing image:**
   ```sh
   docker tag 9dfadec01 sanjoke/redis:latest
   ```
   - This command tags an already built image (referenced by its image ID or SHA).
   - You can use this to add or change tags for images after they are built.

## 🚀 Simple Project with Docker

### 🌐 Create a Web Application

1. Build a simple web app using any language or framework you like.

### 📝 Write a Dockerfile

1. Choose a base image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
1. **📦 Copy your app files into the container:**  
   Example:

   ```dockerfile
   COPY ./ ./
   ```

### 🏗️ Build the Docker Image

1. Run this command to build your Docker image:

   ```
   docker build . -t sanjoke/simplewebapp:latest
   ```

### ▶️ Run the Docker Container

1. Start your app in a container:

   ```
   docker run -p 8080:5000 sanjoke/simplewebapp:latest
   ```

1. **🔌 About the `-p` flag:**  
   `-p INCOMING_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT` maps a port on your computer to the app inside the container.  
   Example: `-p 8080:5000` lets you access the app at `localhost:8080`.

### 👀 View the Web Application

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

### 📂 Set the Working Directory

1. **Set a working directory in your Dockerfile:**  
   Example:

   ```dockerfile
   WORKDIR /home/simplewebapp
   ```

### ⚡ Optimize Docker Builds with Caching

1.  If you copy all files before installing dependencies, Docker will reinstall dependencies every time any file changes:
    ```dockerfile
    COPY ./ ./
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1.  To avoid unnecessary reinstalls, copy only `requirements.txt` first, install dependencies, then copy the rest:
    ```dockerfile
    COPY requirements.txt ./
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    COPY ./ ./
    ```
1.  This way, Docker only reinstalls dependencies if `requirements.txt` changes, making builds faster. 🚀

## 🧩 Docker Compose Introduction

**Docker Compose** is a tool used to define and manage **multi-container Docker applications**. It allows you to describe a set of services (containers), their configurations, networks, and volumes in a single **YAML file** (`docker-compose.yml`), making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications.

### 🎯 Scenario

#### ❓ Problem

Imagine we have a Node.js web application that uses a Redis database to store visitor information. Both the Node.js app and Redis need to run as separate containers.

But how will these two containers communicate with each other? The Node.js app needs to connect to Redis to read, write, and display data. So, how can we manage this connection between the containers?

#### 🚀 Solution 1

We could **manually run both containers** and configure the **networking settings ourselves** to allow them to communicate. However, this approach requires extra effort to manage and maintain the network configuration.

#### 🚀 Solution 2

A better approach is to use a `docker-compose.yml` file. **Docker Compose simplifies container orchestration** and automatically creates a shared network so the Node.js app and Redis container can easily connect and communicate with each other.

### 📝 Docker Compose File Explanation (Beginner Friendly)

This document explains each line of the following `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  redis-server:
    image: redis
  node-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4001:8081"
    restart: always
```

---

### 🧩 `services:`

- **What it does:** Defines a group of services (containers) that will be managed by Docker Compose.
- **Why it matters:** Each service represents a separate container in your app (like a database or web server).

  #### 🗄️ `database-server:`

  - **What it does:** This is the name of the first service (Customizable).
  - **Why it matters:** You can use this name to refer to the service in networks or from other services (e.g., in environment variables).

    ##### 🐳 `image: redis`

    - **What it does:** Tells Docker to use the official **Redis image** from Docker Hub.
    - **Why it matters:** This will pull and run a Redis server without needing a custom Dockerfile.

  #### 🖥️ `webapp-server:`

  - **What it does:** This is the name of the second service (Customizable).
  - **Why it matters:** This service will be your custom Node.js application.

    ##### 🏗️ `build: .`

    - **What it does:** Tells Docker to build an image using the `Dockerfile` in the **current directory** (`.`).
    - **Why it matters:** Instead of using a prebuilt image, this builds one from your app's source code.

    ##### 🔌 `ports:`

    - **What it does:** Maps ports between your computer and the container.
    - **Why it matters:** This allows you to access the app running inside the container from your browser or other tools.

    ##### 🔢 `- "4001:8081"`

    - **What it does:** Maps **port 4001** on your computer to **port 8081** in the container.
    - **Why it matters:** You can visit `http://localhost:4001` to access the app inside the container.

    ##### 🔄 `restart: always`

    - **What it does:** Automatically restarts the container if it crashes or your computer restarts.
    - **Why it matters:** Helps keep your services running without manual intervention.
    - **Options:**
    - `no`: Never restart automatically (default).
    - `always`: Always restart.
    - `on-failure`: Restart only on non-zero exit codes.
    - `unless-stopped`: Restart unless you manually stop the container.
